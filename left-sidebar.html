											</header>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt="" /></span>

											<p>Here are some of the projects that we do throughout the year. Perhaps seeing these projects will give you an idea of what we can do for you!</p>

											<h3>Roses for Rotary</h3>
											<p>Every fall, the Harbourside Rotary Club sells and delivers roses to homes across Victoria. Our club always sends volunteers to help with the packaging and the delivery of the roses. </p>
											<h3>Christmas Cakes</h3>
											<p>Every October, the Harbourside Rotary Club bakes Christmas cakes to sell. Our club always sends volunteers to help with the mixing and baking.</p>
											<h3>Pulling Together Weeding</h3>
											<p>A couple of times a year, our club volunteers to remove invasive species. Over the years we have removed invasive species at Mt. Doug and Point Ellis House, as well as weeds at Parkwood Place Long Term Care Home.</p>
											<h3>Beach Clean-ups</h3>
											<p>At least once a year, Local Projects organizes a beach cleanup. Occasionally part of a Canada wide initiative put on by ????, we have also organized our own cleanups. Some of the beaches that we have picked up litter on include Gyro Beach and Swan Lake. We also hold cigarette butt pickups on the UVic campus.</p>
											<h3>Night of Lights</h3>
											<p>Every year, Hillside Mall reopens late on the last Sunday in November for the Night of Lights. This special event includes door prizes, live music, free food, and mall-wide sales, making it the perfect way to kick start your holiday season. Tickets to enter cost $5, and can be purchased from our club, with 100% of the proceeds going towards the BC Children’s Hospital Festival of Trees.</p>
											<h3>Festival of Trees</h3>
											<p>Every December, the Local Projects Committee organizes tickets sales for the Night of Lights, in collaboration with other fundraising events (bake sales etc.) to raise money to sponsor a Christmas tree at the Festival of Trees. The trees are either on display at the Empress or the Bay Centre, and the money raised goes towards the BC Children’s Hospital. Not only is this an excellent way to support an important institution, but decorating the tree itself with Rotaract colours is also a good opportunity for our club to gain exposure out in the community.</p>
											<h3>Campus Bakesales</h3>
											<p>At least once a semester, our club runs a bake sale on the UVic campus. Generally put on by the Local Projects Committee or the International Projects Committee, the delicious assortment of goodies baked by our club members are always a hit with students and help to raise an impressive amount of money for our various events and charities.</p>
											<h3>Oak Bay Merrython</h3>
											<p>Early in December, the Oak Bay Rotary Club organizes the Oak Bay Merrython. This is a fun run which raises money for ???? and includes a visit from Santa Clause for all the participating kids. Our club provides volunteers to act as marshals along the race course, and some of our members even participate!</p>
											<h3>Literacy Book Drive</h3>
											<p>In order to raise awareness of the 1000X5 Book Recycling Project, our Literacy committee hosts a children's book drive once a year. All of the books are collected and donated to the 1000X5 Organization, and are distributed to children who don't have easy access to these types of books.</p>
											<h3>Our Place Community Lunches</h3>
											<p>About once a year, our club sponsors a hot lunch at Our Place Society for the local homeless and hungry. Often we sponsor the lunch in collaboration with one of the local Rotary Clubs, and members from both clubs volunteer to serve the food and clean up afterwards.</p>
											<h3>Fall Sock Drive</h3>
											<p>Every autumn, our club participates in a sock drive to collect socks for Our Place Society. Originally started by our club, we now partner on the sock drive with the Rotary Club of Downtown Victoria. Each year we collect over 10, 000 socks for donation.</p>
											<h3>End Polio Now</h3>
											<p>Our club has an ongoing account at the Return-It bottle depots into which anyone can donate their returnables’ money. Every 60 cents is enough to vaccinate one child against polio, so for the price of returning a six-pack of beer, you can make a difference in a child’s life!</p>
